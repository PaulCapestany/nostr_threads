As long as the relays cooperate (all good so far), the user's notes appear to be edited.\n\nAh, never mind. It looks like it's an Amethyst-side thing, not a relay-side thing.\n\nI made a lot of unintentional typos in that comment, but I left them alone so I could edit them and then compare it on Amethyst and Primal.
